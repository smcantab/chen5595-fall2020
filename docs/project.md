# Project

The project is the focal point of this course. It will provide you with an opportunity to go through the full research cycle: You will have to assemble a team, identify an idea, write a proposal, conduct the research, write a report in the format of a research paper, and present it to your peers.

## Timeline

- Register team (names) by Sept 29 (Tu week 4)
- Project proposal (1-2 pages) due Oct 20 (Tu week 7)
- Talk (10 minutes) on Oct 22 (Th week 7)
- Progress report (2-3 pages) on Nov 19 (Tu week 11)   
- Final report on Dec 10 (Th week 14)
- Talk (20 minutes) on Dec 15 (last day of instruction)

## The team

You should identify class mates with common interest to form teams of 3-4 students. You can use Piazza to look for team mates. All team members will receive the same score, so make sure you are comfortable with your team.

## Research Idea

The scope of the project is to produce original work at the interface of Machine Learning and Materials Science/Chemical Engineering. This is encompasses an extremely broad spectrum of research topics, from synthetic chemistry to catalysis, to biomedical or biological engineering, to systems engineering, and much more. A good rule of thumb is to look at all the (Core and Graduate) faculty in CEMS: if you come up with an idea, and there is some faculty member working in that same general area, then it is fair game.

### Faculty

I encourage you to consult with faculty with active research programs in an area that you may be interested in, as they may have data or ideas for possible research projects. This is an non-exhaustive list of faculty that you might be interested in talking to for directions on a project idea: Ellad Tadmor (AEM), Ryan Elliot (AEM), Qi Zhang (CEMS), Prodromos Daoutidis (CEMS), Ben Hackel (CEMS), Jason Goodpaster (Chemistry), Ilja Siepmann (Chemistry).

## Talks

Presentation will be during regular classes  should be made with slides via Zoom by one or more team members, it is up to you how you decide to allocate the time.

must talk to TA at least once

## FAQ

- **Is it sufficient to produce a thorough literature review as the project?** No! A literature review is not a project. You must produce an original piece of research. For instance, you may apply a ML approach to solve a scientific or engineering problem, or you can devise/implement a ML tool that serves the needs of the community in that area. The project is your chance to do, experiment with new concepts and learn new tools.

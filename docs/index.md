# About the course

## Overview
This course is meant to be an introduction for advanced-undergraduates or graduate students to probabilistic machine learning (ML) and to recent advances at the intersection of quantum chemistry/materials science and ML.  

After an overview of the fundamental concepts necessary to tackle the subject, namely Probability Theory, Decision Theory, Information Theory, and an exploration of simple probability distributions, the students will be introduced to Mixture Models, Linear Methods, Kernel Methods and Neural Networks (NN). These topics will lay the foundation for a brief discussion of molecular descriptors, Behler-Parrinello NN, and possibly Message Passing NN and Kernel Methods for quantum chemistry.

## Communication
**Class discussion**: Please use Piazza ([sign-up link](https://piazza.com/umn/fall2020/chen5595)) for anything technical e.g. homework or general project-related questions, or anything else that applies broadly to the class. I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza and to try to answer your classmates' work through questions. You can do so anonymously if you do not feel comfortable asking or answering a question publicly.

**Assignments**: will be posted on [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402). Also submit your work via Canvas.

**Email**: contact instructor via email from (strictly) your UMN email account for any confidential issues. Please start the subject line with CHEN 5595.

## Pre-requisites

You must be either a MatS/ChEn graduate student or an upper-division MatS/ChEn major who has taken ChEn 3201, MatS 3141. Students from other PhD programs/majors need to receive instructor's approval. You must have a comfortable knowledge of linear algebra and multivariate calculus. Familiarity with probabilities will be helpful but not strictly necessary. You must know at least one programming language, ideally Python. I will assume that you can transition to writing simple programs in Python autonomously (see ...).

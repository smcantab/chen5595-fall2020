# Course Organization

## Lectures & teaching materials

**Lectures** will be held virtually via Zoom, (link on [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402)). They will be **recorded** an uploaded to YouTube on the same day to an unlisted playlist (link on [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402)).

**Notes** will be uploaded to the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402) after lectures.

**Code** examples will be uploaded to the [course GitHub page](https://github.com/smcantab/chen5595-fall2020).

## Books
**Main textbook**:  
_Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ by C. M. Bishop (free [online version](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)).  
[Official errata](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/prml-errata-1st-20110921.pdf), [more (unofficial) errata](https://github.com/yousuketakada/prml_errata/blob/master/prml_errata.pdf), [algorithms in Python](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML).

**Additional references**:  
_Dive into Deep Learning_ (free [online book](https://d2l.ai/) and [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZSO_6-bSqHQHBCoGaObUljoXAyyqhpFW))  
_Machine Learning meets Quantum Physics_ by K.T. Schutt et al.  
_Data-driven Science and Engineering_ by S. L. Brunton and J. N. Kutz ([video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXbThCXjZFM&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNRpsRhXTMt8uJdIGz9-X_1-))

## Homework
- There will be approx. 10 assignments (written and/or code).
- Assignments will be posted by the end of Friday and are **due by the end of Friday (23:59)** of the following week.
- Submit homework through [Canvas course page](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/193402). For code exercises you should provide a link to a [Google Colab notebook][1] with your code.
- The **worst grade does not count** (see scholastic dishonesty for exceptions), but you cannot skip any assignments (if you do it counts).
- You can be late by 2 days **once**, for whatever reason. Any time after that, late work will not be accepted. There can be additional accommodations in the case of properly documented family emergencies or illness.
- I encourage you to collaborate on homework, but **please do so through Piazza** to the extent that is possible. However, you must come up with your own solutions and write your own code. So, when answering questions on Piazza guide your classmates towards the solution, do **not** post fully worked solutions.

## Grading Policy

Your grade will be based on these components:  

- **Homework**: 50%
- **Project**: 50% (see [Project Grading][2] for the detailed breakdown)

## Scholastic dishonesty
If we determine that there has been a clear instance of scholastic dishonesty, the work will be given a **score of 0** (even if it's the project!) and **it will count** towards the final grade. In addition the case will be reported to OCS.
